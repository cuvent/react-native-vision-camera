### The `isActive` prop

The Camera's `isActive` property can be used to _pause_ the session (`isActive={false}`) while still keeping the session "warm". This is more desirable than completely unmounting the camera, since _resuming_ the session (`isActive={true}`) will be **much faster** than re-mounting the camera view.

For example, you want to **pause the camera** when the user **navigates to another page** or **minimizes the app** since otherwise the camera continues to run in the background without the user seeing it, causing **siginificant battery drain**. Also, on iOS a green dot indicates the user that the camera is still active, possibly causing the user to raise privacy concerns. (ðŸ”— See ["About the orange and green indicators in your iPhone status bar"](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211876))

This example demonstrates how you could pause the camera stream once the app goes into background using a custom `useIsAppForeground` hook:

```tsx
function App() {
  const devices = useCameraDevices()
  const device = devices.back
  const isAppForeground = useIsAppForeground()

  if (device == null) return <LoadingView />
  return (
    <Camera
      style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
      device={device}
      isActive={isAppForeground}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Usage with `react-navigation`

To automatically pause the Camera when the user navigates to a different page, use the [`useIsFocused`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/) function:

```tsx
const isFocused = useIsFocused()

return (
  <Camera
    {...cameraProps}
    isActive={isFocused}
  />
)
```

### Focussing

To focus the camera to a specific point, simply use the Camera's [`focus(...)`](../api/classes/camera.camera-1#focus) function:

```ts
await camera.current.focus({ x: tapEvent.x, y: tapEvent.y })
```

The focus function expects a [`Point`](../api/interfaces/point.point-1) parameter which represents the location relative to the Camera View where you want to focus the Camera to. If you use [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/), this will consist of the [`x`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gesture-handlers/tap-gh#x) and [`y`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/api/gesture-handlers/tap-gh#y) properties of the tap event payload.

So for example, `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` will focus to the upper left corner, while `{ x: CAM_WIDTH, y: CAM_HEIGHT }` will focus to the bottom right corner.

Focussing adjusts auto-focus (AF) and auto-exposure (AE).
