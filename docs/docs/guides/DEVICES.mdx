### What are camera devices?

Camera devices are the physical (or "virtual") devices that can be used to record videos or capture photos.

* **Physical**: A physical camera device is a **camera lens on your phone**. Different physical camera devices have different specifications, such as different capture formats, field of views, frame rates, focal lengths, and more. Some phones have multiple physical camera devices.

  > Examples: _"Backside Wide-Angle Camera"_, _"Frontside Wide-Angle Camera (FaceTime HD)"_, _"Ultra-Wide-Angle back camera"_.

* **Virtual**: A virtual camera device is a **combination of one or more physical camera devices**, and provides features such as _virtual-device-switchover_ while zooming or _combined photo delivery_ from all physiscal cameras to produce higher quality images.

  > Examples: _"Triple-Camera"_, _"Dual-Wide-Angle Camera"_

### Get available camera devices

To get a list of all available camera devices, use the `getAvailableCameraDevices` function:

```ts
const devices = await Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()
```

:::note
See the [`CameraDevice` type](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/blob/main/src/CameraDevice.ts) for more information about a Camera Device
:::

A camera device (`CameraDevice`) contains a list of physical device types this camera device consists of.

Example:
* For a single Wide-Angle camera, this would be `["wide-angle-camera"]`
* For a Triple-Camera, this would be `["wide-angle-camera", "ultra-wide-angle-camera", "telephoto-camera"]`

You can use the helper function `parsePhysicalDeviceTypes` to convert a list of physical devices to a single device descriptor type which can also describe virtual devices:

```ts
console.log(device.devices)
//  --> ["wide-angle-camera", "ultra-wide-angle-camera", "telephoto-camera"]

const deviceType = parsePhysicalDeviceTypes(device.devices)
console.log(deviceType)
//  --> "triple-camera"
```

The `CameraDevice` type also contains other useful information describing a camera device, such as `position` ("front", "back", ...), `hasFlash`, it's `formats` (See [Camera Formats](formats)), and more.

:::caution
Make sure to be careful when filtering out unneeded camera devices, since not every phone supports all camera device types. Some phones don't even have front-cameras. You always want to have a camera device, even when it's not the one that has the best features.
:::

### The `useCameraDevices` hook

VisionCamera provides a hook to make camera device selection a lot easier. You can specify a device type to only find devices with the given type:

```tsx
function App() {
  const devices = useCameraDevices('wide-angle-camera')
  const device = devices.back

  if (device == null) return <LoadingView />
  return (
    <Camera
      style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
      device={device}
    />
  )
}
```

Or just return the "best matching camera device". This function prefers camera devices with more physical cameras, and always ranks "wide-angle" physical camera devices first.

> Example: `triple-camera` > `dual-wide-camera` > `dual-camera` > `wide-angle-camera` > `ultra-wide-angle-camera` > `telephoto-camera` > ...

```tsx
function App() {
  const devices = useCameraDevices()
  const device = devices.back

  if (device == null) return <LoadingView />
  return (
    <Camera
      style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
      device={device}
    />
  )
}
```

### Use-cases

A "use-case" is one of the following:

* **Photo capture** (`photo={true}`) - Taking photos using [`takePhoto()`](/docs/guides/capturing#taking-photos)
* **Video capture** (`video={true}`) - Recording videos using [`startRecording()`](/docs/guides/capturing#recording-videos)/[`stopRecording()`](/docs/guides/capturing#recording-videos)
* **Frame processing** (`frameProcessor={...}`) - Using a Frame Processor (See ["Frame Processors"](/docs/guides/frame-processors))

Camera devices provide the [`maxUseCasesCount` property](/docs/api/interfaces/cameradevice.cameradevice-1#maxusecasescount) which determines how many use-cases the given Camera device supports at the same time.

So if you need to be able to take photos **and** record videos, `maxUseCasesCount` has to be `2` or `3`. If it is `1`, it only supports either the photo use-case, the video use-case or the frame processor use-case - but not multiple of those at the same time.

The `maxUseCasesCount` property has the following values:

* On iOS this value is always `3`.
* On newer Android devices this value is always `3`.
* On older Android devices this value is `1` if the Camera's hardware level is `LEGACY`, `2` if it is `LIMITED` and `3` if it is `FULL`, `LEVEL_3` or above. (See [`INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL) or [the tables at "Regular capture"](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraDevice#regular-capture))

#### Examples

* An app that only supports taking photos works on every Camera device because it only needs `1` use-case.
* An app that supports taking photos and videos works on every Camera device that has a `maxUseCasesCount` of `2` or above. To also make it work on older devices you can fall-back to snapshot capture instead of `photo={true}` on those devices. (See ["Taking Snapshots"](/docs/guides/capturing#taking-snapshots))
* An app that only uses Frame Processors (no taking photos or videos) works on every Camera device because it only needs `1` use-case.
* An app that uses Frame Processors and supports taking photos and videos only works on Camera devices with a `maxUseCasesCount` of `3`. (Or `2` if you fall back to snapshot capture.)

:::note
**Snapshot capture** can be used instead of Photo capture (`photo={true}`) to not occupy a use-case, so if `maxUseCasesCount` is too low for your app you can fall back to _snapshot capture_ instead. (See ["Taking Snapshots"](/docs/guides/capturing#taking-snapshots))
:::

:::note
`audio={true}` is not a use-case.
