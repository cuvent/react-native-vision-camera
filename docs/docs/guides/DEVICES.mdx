### What are camera devices?

Camera devices are the physical (or "virtual") devices that can be used to record videos or capture photos.

* **Physical**: A physical camera device is a **camera lens on your phone**. Different physical camera devices have different specifications, such as different capture formats, resolutions, zoom levels, and more. Some phones have multiple physical camera devices.

  > Examples: _"Backside Wide-Angle Camera"_, _"Frontside Wide-Angle Camera (FaceTime HD)"_, _"Ultra-Wide-Angle back camera"_
* **Virtual**: A virtual camera device is a **combination of one or more physical camera devices**, and provides features such as _virtual-device-switchover_ while zooming (see video on the right) or _combined photo delivery_ from all physical cameras to produce higher quality images.

  > Examples: _"Triple-Camera"_, _"Dual-Wide-Angle Camera"_

### Select any Camera Device

If you simply want to select any device, you can just use whatever is available:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const device = useCameraDevice('back')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const devices = Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()
const device = devices.find((d) => d.position === 'back')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And VisionCamera will automatically find the best matching Camera device for you!

### Select a custom Camera Device

Depending on your app's use-case, you might want to select a different [`CameraDevice`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice) however. There's 3 different physical camera devices:

- `ultra-wide-angle-camera`: The "fish-eye" camera allowing you to do a 0.5x zoom
- `wide-angle-camera`: The "default" camera for most apps
- `telephoto-camera`: A zoomed-in camera allowing you to do a 3x zoom

If you want to allow the user to smoothly switch between Cameras while zooming (as seen in the video on the top right), you need to select a virtual Camera Device consisting of multiple physical Camera Devices:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const device = useCameraDevice('back', {
  physicalDevices: [
    'ultra-wide-angle-camera',
    'wide-angle-camera',
    'telephoto-camera'
  ]
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const devices = Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()
const device = getCameraDevice(devices, 'back', {
  physicalDevices: [
    'ultra-wide-angle-camera',
    'wide-angle-camera',
    'telephoto-camera'
  ]
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will try to find a [`CameraDevice`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice) that consists of all three physical Camera Devices, or the next best match (e.g. "Dual-Camera", or just a single wide-angle-camera) if not found.

If you want to do the filtering/sorting fully yourself, you can also just get all devices, then implement your own filter:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const devices = useCameraDevices()
const device = useMemo(() => findBestDevice(devices), [devices])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const devices = Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()
const device = findBestDevice(devices)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Camera Device Position

A [`CameraDevice`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice) has a [`position`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice#position), which specifies where this Camera Device is located relative to the phone.

- `back`: The Camera Device is located on the back of the phone. These devices can be used for capturing what's in-front of the user.
- `front`: The Camera Device is located on the front of the phone. These devices can be used for selfies or FaceTime.
- `external`: The Camera Device is an external device. These devices can be either:
  - USB Camera Devices (if they support the [USB Video Class (UVC) Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_USB_video_class_devices))
  - [Continuity Camera Devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213244) (e.g. your iPhone's or Mac's Camera connected through WiFi/Continuity)
  - Bluetooth/WiFi Camera Devices (if they are supported in the platform-native Camera APIs; Camera2 and AVFoundation)

Since Camera Devices can change over time (e.g. if `external` devices get plugged in/out, or flip-phones switch positions), there is an API to listen for Camera Device changes:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

The hooks (`useCameraDevice(..)` and `useCameraDevices()`) already automatically listen for Camera Device changes!

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

Add a listener by using the [`addCameraDevicesChangedListener(..)`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#addcameradeviceschangedlistener) API:

```ts
const listener = Camera.addCameraDevicesChangedListener((devices) => {
  console.log(`Devices changed: ${devices}`)
})
// ...
listener.remove()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
